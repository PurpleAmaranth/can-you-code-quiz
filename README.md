# Web APIs: Code Quiz
# can-you-code-quiz

## Description

In this program I create a typical JavaScript coding assessment which includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. This should help you on your coding journey and during the interview process.

This application includes a timed JavaScript coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. It should run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Future Ideas

* Add a feature for multiple correct answers in a question.
* Add other quiz languages like Python and C++.

## Instructions

```
When you're ready to take the code quiz
Click the start button
The timer starts and you are presented with a question
After you answer each question
You are presented with another question
If you answer a question incorrectly
The time is subtracted from the clock
If either all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
The game is over
You can save your initials and see your score
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
